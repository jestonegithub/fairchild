    <p>RDI was the correct response, apparently, because I finally got a response. He'd given me a cipher, and not the last one I'd later find out.</p>
    <p>When I asked what the question was, he told me it'd be easier to discuss on ORC. What follows
        is a transcript of my first chat with @johnny.</p>

        <div class="orc_johnny">@johnny:</div><div class="orc_msg">Hi.</div>
        <div class="orc_author">@moore:</div><div class="orc_msg">should I call you johnny?</div>
        <div class="orc_johnny">@johnny:</div><div class="orc_msg">sure.</div>
        <div class="orc_author">@moore:</div><div class="orc_msg">so, Johnny, what's with the cipher?</div>
        <div class="orc_johnny">@johnny:</div><div class="orc_msg">Proof-of-work. We needed to find someone willing to put in the effort.</div>
        <div class="orc_author">@moore:</div><div class="orc_msg">We?</div>
        <div class="orc_johnny">@johnny:</div><div class="orc_msg">we sent that message to 30 journalists.  15 wrote back "yes".  You were the only one who figured out the correct response.</div>
        <div class="orc_author">@moore:</div><div class="orc_msg">took me a few days...</div>
        <div class="orc_johnny">@johnny:</div><div class="orc_msg">time isn't a constraint here.</div>
        <div class="orc_author">@moore:</div><div class="orc_msg">you said "we"</div>
        <div class="orc_johnny">@johnny:</div><div class="orc_msg">in the 19xx's some researchers did a study on predictors of mathematical ability. They gave students an exam - but first required them to fill out an exhaustive questionnaire: name, age, gpa, parents income, etc.  do you know what they found was the best predictor of high mathematical ability?</div>
        <div class="orc_author">@moore:</div><div class="orc_msg">?</div>
        <div class="orc_johnny">@johnny:</div><div class="orc_msg">how much of the questionnaire the student bothered to fill out. Of all the variables, the proxies for IQ and socio-economic status and previous mathematical knowledge, here was the key: perseverance.</div>
        <div class="orc_author">@moore:</div><div class="orc_msg">that's interesting.</div>
        <div class="orc_johnny">@johnny:</div><div class="orc_msg"> I don't give a damn what your IQ is - I need to know you will follow the rabbit down the hole.</div>
        <div class="orc_author">@moore:</div><div class="orc_msg">I'm really the only one who responded correctly?</div>
        <div class="orc_johnny">@johnny:</div><div class="orc_msg">the only one.</div>
        <div class="orc_author">@moore:</div><div class="orc_msg">so what's the question?</div>
        <div class="orc_johnny">@johnny:</div><div class="orc_msg">you've heard of Alexa Fairchild?</div>
        <div class="orc_author">@moore:</div><div class="orc_msg">of course.</div>
        <div class="orc_johnny">@johnny:</div><div class="orc_msg">we've been working on a theory about her death.</div>
        <div class="orc_author">@moore:</div><div class="orc_msg">theory? Hasn't that mystery been solved?</div>
        <div class="orc_johnny">@johnny:</div><div class="orc_msg">by that idiot Elliott Jackson?</div>
        <div class="orc_johnny">@johnny:</div><div class="orc_msg">do you know Elliott Jackson did before he published that story on Alexa Fairchild?</div>
        <div class="orc_author">@moore:</div><div class="orc_msg">no.</div>
        <div class="orc_johnny">@johnny:</div><div class="orc_msg">he published a story called "Moral Hazard" in some second tier True Crime mag. It was about a guy accused of killing a woman in the town of Hazard, Il back in the 1980's.</div>
        <div class="orc_author">@moore:</div><div class="orc_msg">ok. Never heard of that story.</div>
        <div class="orc_johnny">@johnny:</div><div class="orc_msg">yeah, because he had to retract it a week in - he'd based his whole story on some "info" he'd gathered from some undisclosed source on the dark web.  Within a couple days of its publication readers of the magazine were calling bullshit: His "info" turned out to be nothing more than lyrics from a song that was popular in the 80's.</div>
        <div class="orc_author">@moore:</div><div class="orc_msg">really?  I'd never heard that.</div>
        <div class="orc_johnny">@johnny:</div><div class="orc_msg">yeah- the guy never even bothered to check out the old Wiki records. If he had he'd have seen there was a whole entry on the song that listed most of the lyrics.</div>
        <div class="orc_author">@moore:</div><div class="orc_msg">even if he was a hack the story on Fairchild was huge - surely if there were obvious holes someone would have found them?</div>
        <div class="orc_johnny">@johnny:</div><div class="orc_msg">true. But suppose the holes weren't obvious. Jacobs was spoon fed that story by a source- he admits as much. And he was the only one in a position to dig deep on every detail.</div>
        <div class="orc_author">@moore:</div><div class="orc_msg">you don't believe that Aaron Hillman killed Alexa Fairchild?</div>
        <div class="orc_johnny">@johnny:</div><div class="orc_msg">no.</div>
        <div class="orc_author">@moore:</div><div class="orc_msg">do you have any evidence?</div>
        <div class="orc_johnny">@johnny:</div><div class="orc_msg">yes.</div>
        <div class="orc_author">@moore:</div><div class="orc_msg">are you willing to share it with me?</div>
        <div class="orc_johnny">@johnny:</div><div class="orc_msg">yes, but not yet. First I need you to finish the questionairre.</div>
        <div class="orc_author">@moore:</div><div class="orc_msg"> ?</div>
        <div class="orc_johnny">@johnny:</div><div class="orc_msg">I'll send you another message in a few days. Stand by.</div>

    <p>Three days after our exchange I received another message from Johnny. The message included a random string of letters and numbers, along with a note:</p>

    <i>Can't be too careful. I'm attaching something for you to decrypt. I've already given you the key.</i>

    <p>I'd never had to manually decrypt something myself, but it turned out to be fairly easy to find an online decryption app. I pasted in the encrypted string and then spent 3 hours trying different keys.</p>

    <p>Johnny</p>
    <p>Alexa</p>
    <p>Alexafairchild</p>
    <p>Fairchild</p>

    <p>I started to wonder if this was all some prank. But during a break from punching in keys I found Jackson's retracted story. It did seem odd that someone who'd made such a basic journalistic mistake would land the biggest historical crime story of the last 30 years.</p>

    <p>So I dutifully turned back to trying various keys.</p>
