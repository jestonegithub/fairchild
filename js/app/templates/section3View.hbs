        <p><p class="first_letter">A</p>lexa Fairchild was born on X. She lived and died in a different era from our own. An era before every bit regarding every body was archived and made unalterable.</p>


        <p>Before mystery became a near impossibility.</p>

        <p>What we know comes from an entry in the old Wiki database, last dated X along with a few supplemental documents that showed up in various datamines discovered over the years. All this information had been gathered and placed at the decrypted [address].</p>

        <p>We know she was born in St. Paul, Minnesota. She attended a small liberal arts college Bryn Mawr and then Harvard, where she earned a PhD in theoretical physics. She won various awards.</p>

        <p>Her wiki-entry makes no mention of her disappearance, presumably it occurred after the final updates to the file system. It notes only that she developed a rare form of cancer at 35 and was considering cryonic-treatment.</p>

        <p>In X, Fairchild was profiled in Time magazine's List of 100. It gives by far the richest characterization of her of anything we have.</p>

            <p>Alexa Fairchild, who stands at just over five feet tall, doesn't look particularly formidable. But many of her students and even colleagues find her intimidating. "Her mind just seems to work differently," said a former colleague, himself a world renowned mathematician. "I once brought a theorem to her that I thought she might have some ideas about how to attack. Right there in her office, in the span of forty five minutes she'd basically sketched out a full proof. I'd spent six months trying to prove it myself before I'd showed it to her!"</p>

            <p>The 33 year old physicist who recently received tenure at the illustrious Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, didn't always love math, but she did grow up obsessed with puzzles. Sitting in her office at the IAS her excitement was palpable.</p>

            <p>"I can remember being obsessed with puzzles way back in elementary school. In high school, I got C's in algebra and pre-calculus, because I spent all my time solving strange puzzles," Fairchild recalls. "I was obsessed with an old book I had by Martin Gardner. He was this mathematician who spent his time devising and tweaking puzzles for public consumption."</p>

            <p>Fairchild is such a die hard puzzle fanatic that she has a puzzle tattooed on her [body].</p>

            <p>Fairchild didn't take math seriously until she got to college, but once she did, the gloves came off. "I realized calculus and geometry and even more advanced topics like differential topology - they were all just more abstract versions of puzzles - but puzzles that all fit together in this amazingly unified way."</p>

            <p>She became interested in physics after attending a public lecture by the renowned physicist Lisa Randall. "I heard Randall lecture, on extra dimensions I think, and I was enthralled. Here was this brilliant woman - you didn't see a lot of women represented in physics at the time - using high level mathematics to investigate the deepest puzzles about our universe. I was hooked."</p>

        <p>I also found a few dozen posts on a blog she apparently once maintained. Most of the posts are about her research, flooded with terms like [ ]. But in one post, titled Alexa's Problem, she shared a puzzle she'd come up with herself apparently - in which a (fictional) Cheryl picks two positive numbers, and tells Albert one and Bernard the other and the reader must guess their numbers from the ensuing discussion.</p>

        <div class="puzzle3_lines>"><div class="puzzler3">Cheryl</div> <div class="puzzle3_msg">Hello Albert and Bernard! I have given you each a different number from 0 to infinity. Who of you has the larger number?</div></div>

        <div class="puzzle3_lines>"><div class="puzzler3">Albert</div> <div class="puzzle3_msg">I don't know.</div></div>

        <div class="puzzle3_lines>"><div class="puzzler3">Bernard</div> <div class="puzzle3_msg">I don't know either.</div></div>

        <div class="puzzle3_lines>"><div class="puzzler3">Albert</div> <div class="puzzle3_msg">Even though you say that, I still don't know.</div></div>

        <div class="puzzle3_lines>"><div class="puzzler3">Bernard</div> <div class="puzzle3_msg">And still neither do I.</div></div>

        <div class="puzzle3_lines>"><div class="puzzler3">Albert</div> <div class="puzzle3_msg">Alas, I continue not to know.</div></div>

        <div class="puzzle3_lines>"><div class="puzzler3">Bernard</div> <div class="puzzle3_msg">And also I do not know.</div></div>

        <div class="puzzle3_lines>"><div class="puzzler3">Albert</div> <div class="puzzle3_msg">Yet, I still do not know.</div></div>

        <div class="puzzle3_lines>"><div class="puzzler3">Bernard</div> <div class="puzzle3_msg">I still don't know.</div></div>

        <div class="puzzle3_lines>"><div class="puzzler3">Albert</div> <div class="puzzle3_msg">And I still do not know.</div></div>

        <div class="puzzle3_lines>"><div class="puzzler3">Bernard</div> <div class="puzzle3_msg">I still don't know.</div></div>

        <div class="puzzle3_lines>"><div class="puzzler3">Albert</div> <div class="puzzle3_msg">And I still do not know.</div></div>

        <div class="puzzle3_lines>"><div class="puzzler3">Bernard</div> <div class="puzzle3_msg">I still don't know.</div></div>

        <div class="puzzle3_lines>"><div class="puzzler3">Albert</div> <div class="puzzle3_msg">And I still do not know.</div></div>

        <div class="puzzle3_lines>"><div class="puzzler3">Bernard</div> <div class="puzzle3_msg">Aha! Now I know which of us has the larger number.</div></div>

        <div class="puzzle3_lines>"><div class="puzzler3">Albert</div> <div class="puzzle3_msg">In that case, I know both our numbers too.</div></div>


        <p>I can't say why exactly, but I felt compelled to solve this problem before I continued any further with my research.</p>

        <div class="puzzle3_entry">[first number: __, second number: ___]</div>
